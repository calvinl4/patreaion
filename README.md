# Patreaion

Inspiration
* With the recent controversies surrounding censorship as well as unfair payments on the Patreon platform, we decided to use Aion's decentralized network to create a fairer subscription system. Inspired by the ERC-1337 subscriptions standard, we used timestamps to coordinate pre-signing transactions. In this way, we simplified the existing, cumbersome process of coordinating pre-planned future payments.

What it does
* Content creators can open subscription contracts to allow their followers to support them for additional benefits. By using a platform like Aion, we can promote anti-censorship and ensure that the platform operates in a decentralized anti-authoritarian method.

How we built it
* We've got an AVM contract, being powered in the front with a Vue front-end and Express server. To keep our dependencies low, and stay in the mindset of decentralization, we do not use a database. In the future, we're interested in potentially expanding this further with one-time nonce signing, so that users can manage their profiles directly from their public + private-key pair.
